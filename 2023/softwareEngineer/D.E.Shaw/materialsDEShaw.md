## Largest Programming Project

Project Name: eBay's Average-Time-to-Business (ATB) Dashboard 

Percentage of Code Contributed: 100%, this project was proposed, implemented by me, and later code reviewed by my colleagues

Programming Languages and Tech Stacks used: Javascript (ES6) -> ReactJS, Antd UI Framework, JS-plugin

Purpose and Functionality: the ATB dashboard allows the infrastracture team to monitor the cluster status in real time, and provide immediate feedback if attention/crisis response were needed. Currently, the ATB dashboard is serving a team of over 80 people, facilitating smoother code change rollouts.

## Reflection on a Recent Challenging Project

Project Name: eBay's Average-Time-to-Business (ATB) Dashboard (same as above)

I would like to reflect on the same project above. 
1, Feasibility verification and software architecture design: after proposing ATB dashboard, I spent the first week on reaching out to my colleagues on backend on feasibility of the project and how APIs could be implemented. Then I spent one other week thinking how to structure my code in a maintainable and elegant manner. These two parts not only pushed me to communicate efficiently my needs with teammates but also significantly honed my software architecture design skills (i.e., the ability to oversee the bigger picture). 
2, Teamwork & Code Management: when implementing the project, I seeked many of my senior frontend colleagues for advices and refactored my codes serveral times, in process of which I notably advanced my code management abilities.
3, Agile Development Cycles for Rapid Responses to User Feedbacks: once the ATB dashboard was deployed, I adopted agile programming techniques to quickly respond to user feedbacks and rapidly roll out updates. This helped adapt my application to eBay's ever evolving needs and reduced the infrastructure team's crisis response time by 30%.
