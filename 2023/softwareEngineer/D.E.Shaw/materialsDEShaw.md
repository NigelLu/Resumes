## Largest Programming Project

Project Name: eBay's Average-Time-to-Business (ATB) Dashboard 

Percentage of Code Contributed: 100%, this project was proposed, implemented by me, and later code reviewed by my colleagues

Programming Languages and Tech Stacks used: Javascript (ES6) -> ReactJS, Antd UI Framework, JS-plugin

Purpose and Functionality: the ATB dashboard allows the infrastracture team to monitor the cluster status in real time, and provide immediate feedback if attention/crisis response were needed. Currently, the ATB dashboard is serving a team of over 80 people, facilitating smoother code change rollouts.

## Reflection on a Recent Challenging Project

Project Name: eBay's Average-Time-to-Business (ATB) Dashboard (same as above)

I would like to reflect on the same project above. 
1, Feasibility verification and software architecture design: after proposing ATB dashboard, I spent the first week on reaching out to my colleagues on backend on feasibility of the project and how APIs could be implemented. Then I spent one other week thinking how to structure my code in a maintainable and elegant manner. These two parts not only pushed me to communicate efficiently my needs with teammates but also significantly honed my software architecture design skills (i.e., the ability to oversee the bigger picture). 
2, Teamwork & Code Management: when implementing the project, I seeked many of my senior frontend colleagues for advices and refactored my codes serveral times, in process of which I notably advanced my code management abilities.
3, Agile Development Cycles for Rapid Responses to User Feedbacks: once the ATB dashboard was deployed, I adopted agile programming techniques to quickly respond to user feedbacks and rapidly roll out updates. This helped adapt my application to eBay's ever evolving needs and reduced the infrastructure team's crisis response time by 30%.

Reflecting on a recent project that was both challenging and required a significant amount of creativity, I'd like to revisit eBay's Average-Time-to-Business (ATB) Dashboard project. 

1. Initial Planning and Design Challenges: The project kicked off with a critical phase of feasibility verification and software architecture design. The primary challenge here was ensuring the project's viability by consulting with backend colleagues about potential API integrations and devising a sustainable and sophisticated code structure. Initially, I engaged closely with backend team members to assess the viability of integrating new APIs, dedicating significant effort to understanding how these integrations could enhance the dashboard's functionality. The subsequent week was allocated to meticulously planning the code structure, emphasizing maintainability and sophistication. This phase demanded effective communication and a deep understanding of software architecture, pushing me to enhance my strategic planning and design skills.

2. Collaboration and Code Refinement Hurdles: As the project moved into implementation, I encountered the challenge of integrating diverse feedback and best practices into the codebase. By engaging with multiple front-end colleagues for guidance, I navigated through multiple rounds of code refactoring. This step was crucial for advancing my code management techniques and ensuring the project's success through collaborative problem-solving.

3. Agility in Development and User Feedback Integration: Deploying the ATB dashboard introduced the challenge of adapting quickly to user feedback in a dynamic environment. The adoption of agile development practices enabled me to iterate rapidly on the application, addressing eBay's evolving needs and significantly reducing the infrastructure team's crisis response time by 30%. This stage underscored the importance of flexibility and responsiveness in software development, highlighting my ability to deliver timely solutions in the face of changing requirements.
