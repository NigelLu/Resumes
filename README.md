# Resumes

This repo leverages the power of Git VCS to keep track of all versions of my resume and job-hunting related materials.

## Structure

- First-level: year

- Second-level: Purpose

- Third-level: PDF/docx resumes

## Philosophy

- Use camelCase as naming convention!!!

- As resumes become outdated rather quickly and are used for various purposes, I divide the repo into three levels

- First-level is year so that I never pick outdated resumes, while previous resumes are kept for reference.

- Second-level is purpose, which generally would be types of positions I am applying to. This level allows me to keep resumes that highlight different skill sets in separate folders.

- Third-level is file itself.

- Of course, more levels of abstraction are allowed and can be used when necessary.
